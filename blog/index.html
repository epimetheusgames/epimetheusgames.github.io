                stupid sound check repeatedly
                resonated around the room. And thus, I made it into an equally stupid, but somewhat epic, BeepBox

                Not being an avid gamer, but having likely up to one hundred
                hours in this mess of a game, and more crawling my way through
                the jungle that is the spaghetti code (that I made, something
                I am mildly ashamed to admit) I decided to take my first steps
                to being an intense, sweaty gamer: Speedrunning a puzzle game,
                which sounds like something really sad to do. Somehow I
                completed the entire game in 4:44, which (besides being
                a nice number) is actually pretty impressive, although there
                is definitely room for improvement. If you have the attention
                span to watch it (which you probably don't because it isn't

            <p><i>By Alejandro B: June 9, 2023</i></p>
            <p class="twentyfour">
                The Epimetheus Games website has new custom cursors! Some of you (i.e. us) might recognize the normal
                <code>default</code> cursor, because it's from EyeSore. I went on and made a few more custom cursors,
                following
                some breaking-conventions (ha!) guidelines I set up for myself:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-size: 24px;">All rounded-looking cursors are square-looking</li>
                <li style="font-size: 24px;">All square-looking cursors are rounded-looking</li>
            </ul>

                I will present a demonstration of all the cursors that are currently implemented:

                It's been quite a while since we've posted to this blog,
                as we've been doing stuff over the summer, but we're
                now starting to prepare for OGPC 17, even though there's
                still two months until the theme is announced. One of
                those things is a new, cleaner, minimalistic logo for
                Epimetheus Games. We're trying to incorporate the
                symbol for Epimetheus, basically the god of foolishness
                (and no, we didn't know that when we created the name ...)
                and our school's symbol, the atom. The design will be
                shown off in a future blog post and then replace all our
                logos on our website.

                noticed it makes the website look colorless and seems to be missing something in the middle. We are
                working on it intensly to create a logo we can all agree upon.

                Hello! I'm Liam! the newest addition to the Epimetheus games team! I'm super excited for OGPC this
                year. Admittedly, I'm essentially clueless about anything code-related but I specialise in graphic
                design and branding! You'll see the new logo that I created across all of our accounts and even on
                this website! I'm glad to be on Epimetheus Games, you'll see me here for seasons to come. <br><br>

            <p class="twentyfour">
                For the new logo, I took inspiration from the symbol of the Greek titan "Epimetheus" brother
                of Prometheus. the logo was eventually shortened to just the "key" shape. The "key" is housed
                in two rings reminiscent of the atom logo of the school in which we are based. After multiple
                revisions, I settled on the blue and white ringed key.<br><br>

            <p class="twentyfour">I'm happy to write our first game related blog post of the season, which will outline our basic ideas for the game. First off, we know it will be related to scuba diving, based in the future where the coastline is plagued with storms and flooding. Sea levels are rising and humanity needs to find another place to live. We have a few ideas for our core mechanics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="twentyfour">Attempting to capture hostile fish for research, without killing them.</li>
                <li class="twentyfour">Building underwater housing.</li>
                <li class="twentyfour">Realistic(ish) scuba diving rules.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="twentyfour">Here's an image of a prototype we have so far!</p>

            <p class="twentyfour">Stay tuned for blog posts about the technical aspects of different things we implement, and for new features we plan to add to the game! We look forward to a great season of OGPC this year, and are very interested to see how other teams will interpret the theme of Extreme Weather!</p>

            <h4 id="fishboids"><i>Creating Large Swarms of Fish</i></h4>
            <p><i>By Carson B: December 23, 2024</i></p>
            <p>This blog post is going to cover my process for creating large swarms of fish for our game. In the ocean, there are many types of fish that create large schools. The reason for this is usually for safety and for finding food. Interestingly, schooling can <a href="https://www.aqueon.com/articles/schooling-fish">improve the hydrodynamics</a> of the fish, although I don't really understand why.</p>
            <p>The main topic of this blog post is going to explore the technical side of creating performant large swarms of fish. </p>
            <p>Often in computing we find that extremely simple sets of rules (such as Conway's Game of Life or the Mandelbrot Set) can create extremely complex and beautiful outcomes at a high level. There exists an algorithm called Boids invented by Craig Reynolds which was created to simulate the flocking behavior of birds, but it can also be applied to fish. There are three rules that boids follow (Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion) but I'm not going to explain them all in great detail here.
            </p>
            <p>In its simplest form the boids algorithm possesses an inherent inefficiency as its time complexity is O(n2). Each boid has to check against every other boid. My solution to this is running the boids on the GPU via a compute shader. First I'll get into why that's better in terms of efficiency, and then I'll talk about why it's not the best. </p>
            <p>Firstly, the GPU is massively parallelized, which means that we can rewrite our code to run one boid on each GPU process. This means that the time complexity for one process is O(n) and because all the processes are parallelized the time complexity stays at O(n) for the entire boids simulation. Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple because we can't just run infinite processes, there's a limit. This means our time complexity is still linear but can be more precisely defined as O(n/m) where m is the number of processes that can be run at once. On my machine that's 512.</p>
            <p>Now it's safe to say that at this point the boid simulation is very efficient and is certainly not the bottleneck anymore. The main problem is that in order to make the boids avoid walls I have two choices: Figure out how to get Godot's signed distance field into the compute shader, or suck up the performance cost and do a thousand raycasts on the CPU (in the main thread). So I chose the latter.</p>
            <p>Another bottleneck in this code is waiting for the GPU to process all the data and get it back to the CPU, which stalls the main thread. The best solution to this would probably be to rewrite everything as a particle shader, but I decided to go with the naïve solution which was to move the compute shader initialization to a separate thread, which luckily works with Godot. This was surprisingly easy to make, and I don't have much to say about it. </p>
            <p>And with all that, I was able to create cool-looking stuff like this:</p>
            <img src="/assets/screenshots/divinggameboids.png">
            <p>Overall this was very fun to make and I think it will add a bit more life and wonder into the game. There are certainly some areas for improvement (for example compute shaders don't even work with GLSL), but I think it's good enough that it can be used in the game.</p>

            <h4 id="creatingmusic"><i>Creating Music for our Game</i></h4>
            <p><i>By Alejandro B: May 3, 2025</i></p>
            <p>This blog post is going to cover my process for creating music for our game. In previous years, I have used the online tool <a href="https://beepbox.co/">BeepBox</a>, and other mods of it such as <a href="https://jummb.us/">JummBox</a> and <a href="https://ultraabox.github.io/">UltraBox</a>, to make music for our games. While these tools are great, I feel like I'm not very good at using them for anything other than chiptune-style music, and this year, we decided to steer our music direction away from chiptune and electronic-sounding music in general.</p>
            <p>Outside of video game music, as a composer of classical music I mainly use the music notation software Sibelius to write music. (Nowadays, Sibelius requires an expensive paid subscription to use its full version, but I've been able to get away with using a slightly older version of Sibelius with a permanent license from the olden days.) Sibelius also has quite good audio playback, and lets you export audio of your music. Since Sibelius is the software I'm most familiar with, and it would work well for the type of music we wanted for our game, I decided to use Sibelius to create this year's game's music.</p>
            <img src="/assets/screenshots/sibelius.png" style="max-width: 85%;">
            <p>Despite the time constraints brought around by our school schedule this year, I think the decisions we made concerning our game's music led to some of the best music I've ever made for any of our games, and I hope that you'll enjoy it too.</p>
